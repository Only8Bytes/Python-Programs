In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has, or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤103 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

See Figure 3 for visual example from the sample dataset.
